Transcription factor binding sites - Homework#1.

This script allows us to find transcription factor binding sites and sequences for NKFB.


Initial part of  script will allow users to filter transcription factor bed files for NFKB binding sites.

 Second part will allow user to extract only the genes from the GTF file.

Bedtools will need to be loaded to your pathway.
Bedtools will allow us to get the promoters via bedtools flank.
Using bedtools you will be able to find overlaps between the transcription factors and the promoters.

These overlaps will be given in fasta format for the peaks which which overlap the promoters.
